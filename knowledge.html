<h2>Chapter 1: HTML Basics </h2>
<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The language relies on tags and content within those tags.
    For example: the following line uses the h1 tag. <br> &lt;h1> Hi there!&lt;\h1> <br>
    This tag is used for creating headers on pages. Tags like this one have a beginning tag
    and an end tag (&lt;h1>, &lt;\h1> respectively). Some tags are self closing tags, meaning one should not use
    a close tag with these sort of tags. For example, &lt;br> creates a new line on the page, and requires no closing
    tag. This makes sense, since a line break doesn't really have a beginning and end. The computer just does it.
    However, the computer needs to know when headers are finished, or really any tag which includes content or is
    modifying content (eg. center). We have to tell when we're done.
    <br><br>
    The next piece to know about tags is that some of them have attributes. The header tags, for example, have the
    attribute
    allign, and can be utilized as follows: <br>
    &lth1 align="center">Hello World!&lt/h1> <br>
    This creates the header, "Hello World", and centers it on the page. Attributes are useful for adding customizations
    to elements, thereby aiding in creating a certain page style and format.
    <br>
    The examples here are quite limited; whereas the amount of tags and attributes needs to know in order to create an
    appealing site
    are quite numerous. Fortunately, there are useful resources on the web that make finding pertinent information much
    easier
    than trying to memorize it all. The following sites are quite handy for finding whatever one needs when coding a
    webpage.
    I'm liking devdocs a lot so far. I can find whatever I'm looking for by simply typing in the key term. Nice and
    fast.
    If all else fails, google has my back. Have to get that thrill of efficiency :)

<h2>Side Note</h2>
Evidently, choosing which tag to use isn't as simple as one may think. When it comes to choosing the correct tag
for text content, for example, don't assume that just because your tag does what you want, that it is actually
accomplishing what you want. The tag i and the tag em both make their content italisized but em is actually
what tells browsers that the information is stressed. There is a semantic difference. See <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em" target="_blank">
    i vs em.</a> The tag strong vs the tag b is another example. Both make the text bold, but their semantics are
different.
<h2>More Info</h2>
&lt;ul> is used for unordered lists. In other words, bullet points. &lt;ol>, similarly, is used for ordered lists. Then,
for ul you use style="list-style-type:_____" and fill the blank with whatever attribute you'd like (circle,disc,or
square).
For ol you use type and or start.
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" target="_blank">
    See Docoumentation (ol).
</a>
Within the ul or ol, use &lt;li> to create list elements (bullet points).
<br><br>
<Strong>Example</Strong>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li>ul.1</li>
    <ol type="cirlce">
        <li>ol.1</li>
        <li>ol.2</li>
        <li>ol.3</li>
    </ol>
    <li>ul.2</li>
    <li>ul.3</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tables</h3>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>Table Structure
        <br>
        &lt;table>
        <br>
        &lt;tr>
        <!--Table Row Creation-->
        <br>
        &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
        <!--Table Data/Column Creation-->
        <br>
        &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
        <!--Column Two Info-->
        <br>
        &lt;/tr>
        <!--End Table Row-->
        <br>
        &lt;/table>
        <!--End Table-->
        <br>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The tag table creates the table. The tag tr creates a table row. The tag td creates a table cell/column.
    This is where one puts content into their table. You can create as many rows and columns as you like.
    First useful attribute I've learned about for tables is cellpadding which puts however much space one wants
    between all the elements in the table.
</p>

<h3>Forms</h3>
<p>We probably wouldn't get very far without forms, because forms allow us to take input from the user.
    And of course, the vast majority of websites do this, for text inputs that is.
    <br>
    Creating forms is quite simple. Just use the tag form. Haven't learned much about its attributes yet
    but for now we'll use the method attribute and set it to post.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Label:</strong> this tag puts text on our page which we can use to label form elements such as
    a text box.
    <br><br>
    <strong>Input:</strong> this tag can create an input space for the user, for text, or a click box, or other
    types of inputs. The type atrribute for this tag has many possibilities.
    See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input" target="_blank">MDN</a>

    <strong>Example</strong>
</p>
<form class="" method="post">
    <label>Your Name</label></td>
    <input type="text" name="" value=""></td>
    <input type="submit">
</form>
<p>
    <strong>Code</strong> <br><br>
    &lt;form class="" method="post"> <br>
    &lt;label>Your Name &lt;/label> &lt;/td> <br>
    &lt;input type="text" name="" value=""> &lt;/td> <br>
    &lt;input type="submit"> <br>
    &lt;/form> <br>
