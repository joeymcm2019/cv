    <h2>Chapter 1: HTML Basics </h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. The language relies on tags and content within those tags.
        For example: the following line uses the h1 tag. <br> &lt;h1> Hi there!&lt;\h1> <br>
        This tag is used for creating headers on pages. Tags like this one have a beginning tag
        and an end tag (&lt;h1>, &lt;\h1> respectively). Some tags are self closing tags, meaning one should not use
        a close tag with these sort of tags. For example, &lt;br> creates a new line on the page, and requires no closing
        tag. This makes sense, since a line break doesn't really have a beginning and end. The computer just does it.
        However, the computer needs to know when headers are finished, or really any tag which includes content or is
        modifying content (eg. center). We have to tell when we're done.
        <br><br>
        The next piece to know about tags is that some of them have attributes. The header tags, for example, have the
        attribute
        allign, and can be utilized as follows: <br>
        &lth1 align="center">Hello World!&lt/h1> <br>
        This creates the header, "Hello World", and centers it on the page. Attributes are useful for adding customizations
        to elements, thereby aiding in creating a certain page style and format.
        <br>
        The examples here are quite limited; whereas the amount of tags and attributes needs to know in order to create an
        appealing site
        are quite numerous. Fortunately, there are useful resources on the web that make finding pertinent information much
        easier
        than trying to memorize it all. The following sites are quite handy for finding whatever one needs when coding a
        webpage.
        I'm liking devdocs a lot so far. I can find whatever I'm looking for by simply typing in the key term. Nice and
        fast.
        If all else fails, google has my back. Have to get that thrill of efficiency :)

    <h2>Side Note</h2>
    Evidently, choosing which tag to use isn't as simple as one may think. When it comes to choosing the correct tag
    for text content, for example, don't assume that just because your tag does what you want, that it is actually
    accomplishing what you want. The tag i and the tag em both make their content italisized but em is actually
    what tells browsers that the information is stressed. There is a semantic difference. See <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/em" target="_blank">
        i vs em.</a> The tag strong vs the tag b is another example. Both make the text bold, but their semantics are
    different.
    <h2>More Info</h2>
    &lt;ul> is used for unordered lists. In other words, bullet points. &lt;ol>, similarly, is used for ordered lists. Then,
    for ul you use style="list-style-type:_____" and fill the blank with whatever attribute you'd like (circle,disc,or
    square).
    For ol you use type and or start.
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol" target="_blank">
        See Docoumentation (ol).
    </a>
    Within the ul or ol, use &lt;li> to create list elements (bullet points).
    <br><br>
    <Strong>Example</Strong>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>ul.1</li>
        <ol type="cirlce">
            <li>ol.1</li>
            <li>ol.2</li>
            <li>ol.3</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>Table Structure
            <br>
            &lt;table>
            <br>
            &lt;tr>
            <!--Table Row Creation-->
            <br>
            &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
            <!--Table Data/Column Creation-->
            <br>
            &lt;td>cell info&lt;/td>
            <!--Column Two Info-->
            <br>
            &lt;/tr>
            <!--End Table Row-->
            <br>
            &lt;/table>
            <!--End Table-->
            <br>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The tag table creates the table. The tag tr creates a table row. The tag td creates a table cell/column.
        This is where one puts content into their table. You can create as many rows and columns as you like.
        First useful attribute I've learned about for tables is cellpadding which puts however much space one wants
        between all the elements in the table.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>We probably wouldn't get very far without forms, because forms allow us to take input from the user.
        And of course, the vast majority of websites do this, for text inputs that is.
        <br>
        Creating forms is quite simple. Just use the tag form. Haven't learned much about its attributes yet
        but for now we'll use the method attribute and set it to post.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Label:</strong> this tag puts text on our page which we can use to label form elements such as
        a text box.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Input:</strong> this tag can create an input space for the user, for text, or a click box, or other
        types of inputs. The type atrribute for this tag has many possibilities.
        See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input" target="_blank">MDN</a>
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
    </p>
    <form class="" method="post">
        <label>Your Name</label></td>
        <input type="text" name="" value=""></td>
        <input type="submit">
    </form>
    <p>
        <strong>Code</strong> <br><br>
        &lt;form class="" method="post"> <br>
        &lt;label>Your Name &lt;/label> &lt;/td> <br>
        &lt;input type="text" name="" value=""> &lt;/td> <br>
        &lt;input type="submit"> <br>
        &lt;/form> <br>

    <p><h3>Background Color</h3>
    Background color for a page can be quite easily changed by inserting a line of code into 
    the body tag. <br><br>
    style="background-color: #e5effe;" <br><br>
    For nice color choices, see

    <p><h3>Styling all tags in a file with one go</h3></p>
    <p>Use the style tag to make modifications to all tags of your choice throughout your file. For example,
        you can change all the hr tags at once, or all the table tags at once. Just use the style tag 
        to make the modifications you want to see for each instance of these elements.
    <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong><br><br>
        &lt;style> <br>
        hr { <br>
            height: 3px; <br>
            background-color: #000000;  <br>
            border-style: none; <br>
        } <br>
        &lt;/style> <br><br>

    This changes any hr tags (that don't have these attributes specified) in your file to have 
    these attribute specifications. No more rewriting the same code over and over again. All 
    hr tags in this file will have these attributes. All you have to is write &lthr> and your done!
    Good time saver!
    
    <br><br>
    <strong>Corollary</strong><br><br>

    Implementing such changes across all pages of a site is the next step. And it's simple! One simply needs
    to create a css file where they will store these stylings. Then, in the header section of each page, one 
    simply adds the folling line: <br><br>

    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css"><br><br>
    
    As you can see I used a folder called css, and my css file was styles.css. Using this line in each page I have
    ensures that each page will implement the same stylings that I have chosen. This makes it much easier
    to make changes across the entire site. Quite nice!
    
    <br><br>
    <strong>CSS Syntax</strong><br><br>
    Once inside the css document, the following syntax is used to modify whatever elements one would like.
    <br><br>

    selector { property: value; } 

    <br><br>

    Selector: what tag do you want to modify? <br>
    property: what attribute do you want to modify from the tag? <br>
    value: how do you want to modify the attribute? <br><br>
    Pretty simple!

    <br><br>
    Finding the selector is probably going to be the easy part. But finding the right property that will change 
    what you want--that might not be so easy sometimes. So, MDN here we come: <br><br>

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference?adlt=strict&toWww=1&redig=51791ED79FE446ACB9FB88735ADA87DE"
    target="_blank">Properties</a><br><br>

    <strong>The class and id selectors</strong><br><br>
    Want to use different settings on the same tag? For example, want your h1 to be blue sometimes but other times
    have it be red? It's quite simple! But, BE WARNED! The id selector can only be used once per page! The class selector,
    on the other hand, can be used to modify as many tags as you want! See examples below for how to set these up: <br><br>

    class example: <br> &lt;h1 class="blueHeader">  <br>
    id example: <br> &lt;h1 id="blueHeader"> <br><br>

    These lines make it so this h1 will follow the CSS stylings set up for the class blueHeader. Now all we have 
    to do is add a little code to our style.css. Note the dot before the class label 
    and the # before the id label. This is important!! 
    See below: <br><br>

    class example: <br>

    .blueHeader { (DON'T FORGET THE DOT!!)<br>   
        background-color: "blue"; <br>
    } <br><br>

    id example: <br>

    #blueHeader { (DON'T FORGET THE #!!)<br>   
        background-color: "blue"; <br>
    } <br><br>


    We can do the same thing for a redHeader by repeating the process. Pretty handy! Note: 
    the class and id selectors are more specific than tag selectors, meaning they have higher
    precedence.<br><br>

    <strong>Multple Class Selection</strong><br><br>
    To apply multiple classes to a tag, simply add a space and another class name within the
    class selector. See below: <br><br>

    &lt;h1 class="blueHeader bigFont"> <br><br>
    
    <strong>NOTE:</strong> you cannot have multiple id selectors for a tag. <br><br>

    <strong>Psuedo Classes</strong><br><br>
    Psuedo Classes are used when you want to affect an element when it's in a different state. Yes, elements have 
    different states. For example, when a user <strong><em>hovers</em></strong> over an element with their mouse,
    this puts that element in a different state. Thus, html has a hover state. See example below for how to use: 
    <br><br>

    In our style.css:<br>
    h1:hover { <br>
        color: "orange"; <br>
    } <br><br>

    This code will make it so whenever we hover over an h1, it will change its color to orange.
